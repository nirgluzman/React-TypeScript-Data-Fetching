When fetching data, it can be a good idea to parse & validate the fetched data to check 
if it's in line with our data structure expectations.
Zod is a great library for doing that valiation, because this library embraces TypeScript and 
it is written such that TypeScript is able to infer the structure of the parsed / validated data.
Zod installation: npm install zod
